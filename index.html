              <p class="card-text">The map above displays the number of mental health providers per 1,000 people of Florida counties: Generally, counties along the Eastern coast of the state had more mental health providers per 1,000 people. Only 2 counties had > 2.4 mental health providers per 1,000 people; interestingly enough, these counties were adjacent to some of the only counties with <.3 mental providers per 1,000 people. Additionally, there is a cluster of counties in South-Central Florida with lower rates of mental health providers per 1,000 people.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The point symbol map above displays the number of firefarm fatalities in California counties in 2019 with a graduated symbol scheme: Generally, the populous counties along the central and southern coast of California had the highest raw counts of firearm fatalities. While most of the northern counties had fewer than 81 firearm fatalities, Humboldt and Shasta each had over 100. Multiple central counties, including Sacramento, San Joaquin, Santa Clara, Contra Costa, and Alameda had 400-600 firearm fatalities. However, among the southern California counties, San Diego had and Los Angeles held the highest raw counts of firearm fatalities.</p>

However, the coastal counties in this region had higher rates of suicide compared to the centermost counties. A small cluster of counties in the south-central region had low prevalence of mental health providers alongside a high suicide rate. Among the northern region of the state, another cluster of counties with low prevalence of mental health providers and high suicide rates is observed. Interestingly, every county that had both a high prevalence of mental health providers and a high suicide rate was along the outside border of the state.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The application above utilizes a small multiples technique to compare SNAP benefit utilization with other variables in Miami, Florida. In terms of spatial trends of the data, it appears that the census tracts in the densely populated northern region of the metropolitan area had the highest utilization of SNAP benefits. There was also a small cluster of utilization in the south-central part of the metropolitan area. While many tracts within these areas had high prevalence of children (ages 0-17), some still fell in the mid-range of around 20% children. There tended to be higher percentages of children in the distant, suburban parts of the Miami metropolitan area. Poverty rates tended to be the highest in areas with high utilization of SNAP benefits, too. Generally, poverty rates in these clustered areas of SNAP utilization were around 20-35%.  On the other hand, the prevalence of seniors (ages 65+) trended the least with SNAP utilization by household. Some tracts in the northern cluster of SNAP utilization had a high percentage of seniors (~20%), but most tracts with a high percentage of seniors were physically between the clusters of high poverty and SNAP utilization by household. </p>
